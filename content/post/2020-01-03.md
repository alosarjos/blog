I'm getting prepared for what is ahead. I hope this year I'll be able to redo 
the BackLogger project with a new Rust based backend and a refreshed UI on Flutter.

But thing is, lots of books are also showing up on my TODO list. And on top of that, I just found some amazing web pages for making some exercises to improve
my clean code capabilities and my Rust level.

So I'm guessing that for theses days, I will just find a way to organize my time
for all these tasks. Hoping some known apps such as Todoist can help me with it.
